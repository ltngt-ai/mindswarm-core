Write File Command

This command provides a direct interface to the write_file tool,
allowing users and agents to write files through the command system.
This supports the agent-first architecture by providing both:
1. Direct command access (/write_file path content)  
2. Tool integration through the existing WriteFileTool

Usage:
    /write_file <path> <content>
    /write_file path/to/file.txt This is the content to write

The command delegates to the WriteFileTool to perform the actual file operation,
ensuring consistent behavior between command and tool usage.
